# React App Setup

This is a guide to help you set up and run a React application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Download and install the latest version of Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm or yarn**: npm is installed with Node.js. You can also install Yarn by following the instructions on [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the React app:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Satyendra3335/React-to-do-list.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4. **Run the application**:

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Or using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    The application will start and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- `npm start` or `yarn start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test` or `yarn test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject` or `yarn eject`: Removes the single build dependency from your project. **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
